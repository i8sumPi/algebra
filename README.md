# Algebra
Welcome to my algebra expression (or equation) simplifier, made with vanilla JavaScript! It supports addition, subtraction, division (by numbers only), multiplication, and exponents.

## How to Run
To see it in action, go [here](http://kiraprograms.com/equation-simplifier). To see the code, go to `script.js`.

## How it works
Go to `script.js` to see the commented code. The function `doAll("...")` simplifies something. 

On a high level, it works by parsing the expression as a string (it doesn't convert the expression into computer-readable code). I started by making a parser for just arithmetic, and then expanded it to work with variables as well. 

## Bugs
I've done a lot of debugging with this but there's probably still bugs in there. If you find one, *please* let me know by starting an issue.
